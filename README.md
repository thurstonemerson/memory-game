##Game Description:

Which player has the better memory? In this simple 2 player game of memory beloved by children the world round,
you flip two cards and remember the pictures on them. If you don't get a match then it is the next player's turn.
If you get a match, then you can flip two more cards! Whoever collects more pairs is the winner. 

Each board contains a pair of cards from the 8 possible card types:
DEATH,TEMPERANCE,HIGH_PRIESTESS,HERMIT,HANGED_MAN,LOVERS,JUSTICE,FOOL

The board is represented as a 2D list of cards with XXX indicating an unflipped
card and the card name indicating a flipped card:
[[XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX], 
[XXX, HANGED_MAN, XXX, XXX], 
[XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX], 
[XXX, XXX, XXX, HERMIT]

For API testing purposes, a board may be represented as a 2D list of cards and
a boolean value indicating whether or not the card has been flipped:
[[FOOL:False, TEMPERANCE:False, LOVERS:False, HANGED_MAN:False], 
[TEMPERANCE:False, HANGED_MAN:False, JUSTICE:False, DEATH:False], 
[HERMIT:False, DEATH:False, JUSTICE:False, HIGH_PRIESTESS:False], 
[FOOL:False, HIGH_PRIESTESS:False, LOVERS:False, HERMIT:False]]
